    "Use strong encryption and explicit access control/permissions so only authorized users can access uploaded notes/files.",
    "Add file metadata (e.g., display name and description) to the canister data model and expose authorized update APIs restricted to the file owner.",
    "Mainnet deployment requires a funded cycles wallet/canister; ensure sufficient cycles are available before attempting `dfx deploy --network ic`.",
    "ICP uses a reverse-gas model: the app canister pays cycles for compute/storage; implement monetization as an application-level paywall (subscription/credits) rather than direct user-paid cycles.",
    "Implement payment verification and entitlement tracking per user principal (e.g., accept payments via ckBTC/ckICP flows and mark principals as active/paid before allowing uploads).",
    "Admin access-management UI requires a backend query to list all principals with access plus associated metadata (plan label/expiration) and aggregated per-principal storage usage (sum of stored file sizes).",
    "Storage/files are stored in this app’s canister(s); under ICP’s reverse-gas model the canister owner/app pays cycles for storage (not end users), so per-principal usage tracking is needed for admin oversight/monetization.",
    "File preview UX decision: clicking a file should open a dedicated full preview view that replaces the existing file detail panel; non-previewable types show a fallback message instead of triggering download automatically.",

    "Caffeine can deploy a live frontend at a stable URL even if the backend canister is missing/stopped; after deploy, confirm and record the real mainnet backend canister ID(s) for monitoring and cycles top-ups (NNS canister linking requires the canister to actually exist on mainnet)."
