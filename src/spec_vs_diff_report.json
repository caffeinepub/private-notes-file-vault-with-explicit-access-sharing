  "summary": "The diff implements a more robust IC deploy script with preflight/build steps, log file creation under frontend/deploy-logs, and explicit canister-existence checks/creation (at least for the backend, with the remainder truncated). DEPLOYMENT_IC.md is described as expanded to include mainnet steps and troubleshooting. However, substantial unrelated application feature work (paywall/admin functions and many UI feature summaries) appears in the changes despite not being requested.",

    {
      "description": "Added/modified backend paywall/admin-related types and functions (e.g., PaywallStatus, AdminPaywallStatus, setPaywallStatus, getPaywallStatus, getCallerPaywallStatus, getAllAdminPaywallStates), which are unrelated to mainnet deployment reliability requirements.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest non-goals explicitly exclude adding new application features unrelated to mainnet deployment reliability; the requested work was limited to the deploy script and deployment documentation.",
